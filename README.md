A Serverless plugin that deploys a web client for your Serverless project to an S3 bucket, and make it publicaly available in seconds.

**First**, install:

```
npm install --save serverless-client-s3
```
**Second**, update `serverless.yml` by adding the following:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-client-s3
custom:
  client:
    bucketName: serverless-client-bucketname
```

* **Warning:** The plugin will overwrite any data you have in the bucket name you set above if it already exists.


**Third**, Create a `client/dist` folder in the root directory of your Serverless project. This is where your distribution-ready website should live. It is recommended to have a `client/src` where you'll be developing your website, and a build script that outputs to `client/dist`. The plugin simply expects and uploads the entire `client/dist` folder to S3, configure the bucket to host the website, and make it publicly available.

Or just copy/run the following commands in the root directory of your Serverless project to get a quick sample website for deployment:

```
mkdir -p client/dist
touch client/dist/index.html
touch client/dist/error.html
echo "Go Serverless" >> client/dist/index.html
echo "error page" >> client/dist/error.html
```

**Fourth**, run the plugin, and visit your new website!

```
serverless client deploy [--stage $STAGE] [--region $REGION]
```

**Fifth**, Have fun!
